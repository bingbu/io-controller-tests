My typical usage is

	$ ./bay buffered-write direct-write mixed-write-2  # and possibly more cases
	$ feh log/buffered-write-XXXXXX/
	$ vim log/buffered-write-XXXXXX/trace.bz2

There are 4 types of scripts.

1) master scripts for running locally

	bay
	fat
	snb

One script for each test box. They
- send the scripts to the remote test box
- in the remote test box, run the specified test cases
- copy back the test results

You may want to create some new ones for yourself :-)

2) master script for running inside the test box

	run

3) individual test cases

	buffered-writes*
	direct-writes*
	mixed-writes*

They should be feed as parameters to the "run" or "bay/fat/snb" scripts.

4) plot scripts

	plot-*

Unfortunately they depend on several trace events in my private patch queue..
